## Story

As a power user,  
I want to configure push-to-talk activation behavior,  
so that I can avoid conflicts with other global shortcuts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.
   **Given** the settings UI is opened  
   **When** the user changes the push-to-talk hotkey configuration  
   **Then** the new configuration is persisted and used for subsequent activations (FR30)  
   **And** invalid/unsupported hotkey choices are rejected with an explanation  


## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: the settings UI is opened (AC: #1)
  - [x] Implement main-process/service changes for AC #1
  - [x] Implement preload API surface for AC #1 (if IPC/UI needed)
  - [x] Implement renderer UI updates for AC #1 (if needed)
  - [x] Add minimal sanity checks / smoke tests for AC #1

## Dev Notes

### Non-negotiable guardrails

- **Renderer is UI-only** (no clipboard/mic/db/automation).
- **Main owns privileged operations**; preload is the only bridge.
- **IPC**: `clipmorph:<domain>:<action>`, envelope `{ ok, requestId, data|error }`, events bus `clipmorph:events`.
- **Job model**: `pending | running | needs_input | completed | failed | cancelled` (monotonic transitions).
- **Clipboard correctness**: snapshot gating, pending-means-no-change, 2-deep undo, self-trigger immunity.

### Technical requirements (story-specific)

- Keep scope tight: implement only what the ACs require; no speculative features.
- Prefer deterministic implementations over LLM-dependent behavior where possible.
- If you need to introduce a new library, document why and ensure it doesn’t violate locked stack decisions.

### Architecture compliance

- Follow `_bmad-output/project-context.md` and `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` exactly; do not introduce alternate patterns.

### Latest Tech Information

- electron-vite convention: `src/main/*`, `src/preload/*`, `src/renderer/*`, `electron.vite.config.ts`.
- Preload pattern: `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld(...)` with a narrow allowlist; prefer `ipcMain.handle` / `ipcRenderer.invoke` for request/response.

### Project Structure Notes

- Keep filenames `kebab-case.*` and IPC/channel constants centralized (no stringly scattered literals).
